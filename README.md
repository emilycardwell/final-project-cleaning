# Cleaning scraped chords from [Kaggle's "Chords and Lyrics" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eitanbentora/chords-and-lyrics-dataset)

### Chords create a unique predicament in data cleaning due to their use of symbols (# – sharp, or one-half-step between whole notes, º – diminished chord, etc.)

In retrospect it might have been more productive to try to create a dictionary of chords to search for and accept, rather than filtering out the unwanted symbols or chords. This is on the backburner at the moment but I'd like to return to it and make it a bit more concise.
